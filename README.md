==== Droplift ====

Droplift lifts drops out of solid blocks.
This mod adds no in-world items or blocks, just additional physics.

Droplift also prevents buried drops from sinking below the floor
when the game reloads.

Goals:
* Controlled item elevation through blocks, so it can be used reliably
  in plans and contraptions.
* As computationally 'nice' as possible.
* In balance with game play and physics. Generally handy and fun,
  but not excessive or distracting.

Design choices:
* Moves by whole nodes only.
* Treats all nodes as whole cubes.
* Lifts at about 1 m/s.
